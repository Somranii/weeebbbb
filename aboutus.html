        <p>Good morning/evening,<br> we're Med arbi ,Med aziz and Med nacer, co-founders of 3aweni !.<br>
                      We’ve been friends for two years: met at college, studied together and we started this new
                      business together (you could call us “tripple med” entrepreneurs…). <br>
                      We grew up in a country named tunisia located in the middle-east exactly in the north africa<br>
                      The people who live there, particularly disabled people, are not only demanding more money to buy what they need,
                      they are also demanding more respect and assistance.<br>
                      Now that we're adults, we've searched for years for a solution to help those people and make them 
                      happier.<br>
                      The best solution we made was creating a website to claim money,gifts.. to give to disabled people
                      to provide their needs.<br> 
                      That's what 3aweni is all about-we hope you enjoy! </p>
